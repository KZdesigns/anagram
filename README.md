# Anagram
Our goal today is to write a method that determines if two given words are anagrams. This means that the letters in one word can be rearranged to form the other word. For example:

```Ruby
anagram?("gizmo", "sally")    #=> false
anagram?("elvis", "lives")    #=> true
Assume that there is no whitespace or punctuation in the given strings.
```

## Learning Goals
- Be able to determine the time and space complexity of a method
- Be able to recognize when and how time or space complexity can be improved
- Be able to compare different methods and discuss how changing inputs affects each one's overall runtime
